If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

Most data in Factor lives in *sequences*. Arrays, vectors, and
strings are all sequences and share a common set of words from the
[`sequences`][sequences] vocabulary.

## Array literals

A literal array uses `{ }` with whitespace between elements:

```factor
{ 1 2 3 } .          ! => { 1 2 3 }
{ "a" "b" "c" } .    ! => { "a" "b" "c" }
```

Arrays are read-only — words like `suffix` and `remove-nth` return
a *new* sequence rather than mutating the original.

## Length and indexing

```
length   ( seq -- n   )
first    ( seq -- elt )
rest     ( seq -- tailseq )    ! everything but the first element
last     ( seq -- elt )
but-last ( seq -- headseq )    ! everything but the last element
nth      ( n seq -- elt )      ! 0-based
```

```factor
{ 10 20 30 } length .       ! => 3
{ 10 20 30 } first .        ! => 10
{ 10 20 30 } rest .         ! => { 20 30 }
{ 10 20 30 } last .         ! => 30
{ 10 20 30 } but-last .     ! => { 10 20 }
1 { 10 20 30 } nth .        ! => 20
```

## Slicing

```
head ( seq n -- headseq )    ! first n elements
tail ( seq n -- tailseq )    ! drop first n
```

```factor
{ 1 2 3 4 5 } 3 head .   ! => { 1 2 3 }
{ 1 2 3 4 5 } 3 tail .   ! => { 4 5 }
```

Both throw if `n` is larger than the sequence. If `n` is too big,
`index-or-length` shrinks it down to the sequence's length, so the
slice that follows can't run off the end:

```
index-or-length ( seq n -- seq n' )
```

```factor
{ 10 20 30 40 50 } 3 index-or-length head .   ! => { 10 20 30 }
{ 10 20 } 3 index-or-length head .            ! => { 10 20 }
```

The starred variants `head*` and `tail*` count from the end —
`head*` drops the last `n`, `tail*` keeps the last `n`:

```
head* ( seq n -- headseq )   ! everything except the last n
tail* ( seq n -- tailseq )   ! the last n elements
```

```factor
{ 1 2 3 4 5 } 2 head* .   ! => { 1 2 3 }
{ 1 2 3 4 5 } 2 tail* .   ! => { 4 5 }
```

For an arbitrary slice between two indices, `subseq` takes the
*start* (inclusive) and *end* (exclusive):

```
subseq ( from to seq -- subseq )
```

```factor
1 4 { 10 20 30 40 50 } subseq .   ! => { 20 30 40 }
1 4 "hello" subseq .              ! => "ell"
```

When you have a *start and a length*, add them to get the end:

```factor
2 dup 3 + "hello world" subseq .  ! => "llo"
```

(That's the index range `[2, 5)` — three characters starting at
position 2.)

The reverse question — *where* a subsequence occurs — is answered
by `subseq-index`, which returns the starting index of the first
match, or `f` when there is none:

```
subseq-index ( seq subseq -- i/f )
```

```factor
"hello world" "o w" subseq-index .   ! => 4
"hello world" "xyz" subseq-index .   ! => f
```

## Padding

```
pad-head ( seq n elt -- padded )    ! prepend copies of elt
pad-tail ( seq n elt -- padded )    ! append copies of elt
```

Both extend `seq` until its length is at least `n`. If `seq` is
already that long, it is returned unchanged.

```factor
{ 2 5 0 } 6 0 pad-tail .   ! => { 2 5 0 0 0 0 }
{ 4 1 } 5 9 pad-head .     ! => { 9 9 9 4 1 }
```

## The same words work on strings

A string is a sequence of characters, so everything above works on
strings too — the result is just another string instead of an array:

```factor
"hello" length .            ! => 5
"hello" 3 head .             ! => "hel"
"abc" 6 CHAR: . pad-tail .   ! => "abc..."
```

## Aggregating

`sum` and `product` (in [`sequences`][sequences])
add or multiply the elements of a numeric sequence:

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 } sum .        ! => 14
{ 2 5 3 7 } product .    ! => 210
```

`count` runs a predicate over the sequence and returns how many
elements made it true:

```
count ( seq quot -- n )
```

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 4 1 } [ even? ] count .    ! => 3
```

## Predicates over the whole sequence

```
any?   ( seq quot -- ? )
all?   ( seq quot -- ? )
empty? ( seq -- ? )
```

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 } [ 4 > ] any? .      ! => t
{ 2 5 0 7 } [ 0 > ] all? .      ! => f
```

## Building a new sequence

`suffix` adds an element to the end of a sequence; `prefix` adds one
to the front. `unclip` peels off the first element and `unclip-last`
peels off the last:

```
prefix      ( seq elt -- newseq )
suffix      ( seq elt -- newseq )
unclip      ( seq -- rest first )
unclip-last ( seq -- butlast last )
```

```factor
{ 7 9 } 3 prefix .             ! => { 3 7 9 }
{ 7 9 } 3 suffix .             ! => { 7 9 3 }
{ 4 0 9 } unclip .s
! => { 0 9 }
! => 4
```

Combining `unclip-last` and `suffix` gives a non-destructive update
of the last element (and `unclip` + `prefix` does the same for the
first):

```factor
{ 10 20 30 } unclip-last 2 * suffix .
! => { 10 20 60 }
```

## Coercing between sequence types

`>array`, `>vector`, and `>string` (in [`arrays`][arrays] and
the corresponding vocabularies) force a sequence into a
particular concrete type. Useful when an operation returned a
slice or generic sequence and you need an array (or string)
back.

```factor
{ 1 2 3 } 1 tail >array .   ! => { 2 3 }
"hello" >array .            ! => { 104 101 108 108 111 }
{ 65 66 67 } >string .      ! => "ABC"
```

## Instructions

You're an avid bird watcher who keeps a daily count of the birds
visiting your garden. The counts are stored in an array, oldest day
first.

## 1. Today's count

Define `today` to take the array of daily counts off the stack and
return the count for today.

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 4 1 } today .
! => 1
```

## 2. Increment today's count

Define `increment-todays-count` to return a new array with today's
count increased by one. The original array should not be modified.

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 4 1 } increment-todays-count .
! => { 2 5 0 7 4 2 }
```

## 3. Was there a day with no birds?

Define `has-day-without-birds?` to return `t` if at least one day
recorded zero birds, otherwise `f`.

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 4 1 } has-day-without-birds? .
! => t

{ 2 5 1 } has-day-without-birds? .
! => f
```

## 4. Sum the first few days

Define `count-for-first-days` to take an array of counts and a number
`n`, and return the sum of the first `n` counts.

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 4 1 } 4 count-for-first-days .
! => 14
```

## 5. Count the busy days

A busy day is one with five or more birds. Define `busy-days` to
return the number of busy days in the array.

```factor
{ 2 5 0 7 4 1 } busy-days .
! => 2
```

## 6. Pad missing days

If you didn't watch on every day of an `n`-day stretch, fill the
missing trailing days with `0`. Define `pad-missing-days` to take
an array of counts and a target length `n`, and return an array
of length at least `n` whose extra slots are `0`. Existing counts
must be preserved unchanged; if the input is already at least `n`
long, return it unchanged.

```factor
{ 2 5 0 } 7 pad-missing-days .
! => { 2 5 0 0 0 0 0 }

{ 4 1 6 8 } 3 pad-missing-days .
! => { 4 1 6 8 }
```
