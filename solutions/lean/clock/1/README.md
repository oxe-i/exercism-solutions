# Clock

Welcome to Clock on Exercism's Lean Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

To complete this exercise you need to define the data type `Clock`, add a `BEq` and a `ToString` instance, and implement the functions:

* `create`, that takes two integers, possibly negative, representing hours and minutes respectively, and creates a valid Clock.
* `add`, that takes a Clock and a number of minutes to be added to the time in the Clock, generating a new Clock.
* `subtract`, that takes a Clock and a number of minutes to be subtracted from the time in the Clock, generating a new Clock.

Note that the Clock type represents a 24 hour clock going from "00:00" to "23:59".

Note that both the hours and the minutes in a `Clock` are bounded:

- `0 <= hour < 24`
- `0 <= minute < 60`

It is idiomatic in Lean to represent such constraints at the type level, so that invalid values are _unrepresentable_.
However, this also requires _proving_ that a given value satisfies these constraints.

If you are feeling up to it, here is a good introduction to this topic:
