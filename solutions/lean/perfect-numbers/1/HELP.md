## Running the tests

To run the tests, make sure you have Lean 4 installed.
You can refer to the [installation][installation] page for more information.

From the exercise directory, run:

```bash
lake test
```

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit PerfectNumbers.lean` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
