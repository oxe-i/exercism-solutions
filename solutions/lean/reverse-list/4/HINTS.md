# Hints

## General

- The tactic [`funext`][funext] can reduce a proof of equality between functions to proving that they return the same value for all possible arguments.
It introduces a new argument into the proof, representing an input applied to both functions.

- Using `@` before a function makes all [implicit parameters][implicit-parameters] explicit.
That means type variables can be brought into scope with `funext`.

- The [`induction` tactic][induction-tactic] is often useful for constructing proofs by [mathematical induction][mathematical-induction] on inductive types.

- Simplification tactics such as [`simp`][simp] may help after applying induction.

- There are many `List` lemmas that can serve as a starting point for your proof.
They are listed in the [API reference][api-reference], particularly in [Init.Data.List.Basic][list-basic] and [Init.Data.List.Lemmas][list-lemmas].
